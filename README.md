Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

    I believe that the HTML files and general CSS files were correctly implemented for the most part.
    I attempted to use the flexbox feature, and I am unsure if it was correctly implemented. 
    I was able to see some changes in the general functionality of the site. 

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.


    I only discussed the assignment in Piazza, by asking questions and reading over posts. Additionally
    I consulted multiple sites for help, especially with CSS features. The sites are attached below:

Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

    I worked on the assignment for about three days. Each day had about 1:30 to 2:00 hours of work.
    The task that took me the most time was formatting.
