		<h1>Joaquin Bustamante's Short Biography</h1>
		<h2>The Beginning</h2> 
		<p>My story is unlike any other. I was not born the same as everyone else.
		My father was the viceroy of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, as a second child I was never 
		eligible for succession to the throne; nevertheless, I never had the chance to fight for the throne. </p>

		<p>I remember it clearly. It was the morning after my fifth Easter when we were awoken by the guards. 
		I can still remember that cold morning. The sun had barely come out, and I could 
		hear cannons blasting in the distance. My parents told us to gather just a few belonging, 
		put them in the small suitcase and wait in the back patio of the Narino Palace. 
		I remember seeing the house empty; which was unusual as many government people would flood 
		the hall with meeting and loud discussions. This time the palace was silent.</p>

		<p>The blades of chopper broke through the air, and I could see it approaching in the distance,
		 making its way towards the yard. My father finally joined us and smiled in relief. It was short 
		lived. The rebels had taken the avenue leading to the palace and fired at the helicopter bringing it 
		down a couple of hundred meters from where we were. The Viceroy, my dad, whom I had never seen panicked 
		starting screaming and told us to run to horse stables. There, luckily I met my equestrian teacher, named Carlos, 
		and my father told him to take me with him. My little sister went with the nanny and my older brother with the butler. 
		That was the last time I saw my parents.</p>

		<h2>Living with the Coach</h2>

		<p>After the coup, I went to live in secrecy with Carlos in his rural house near the lake. 
		I had a simple life, full of fear as the cleansing was still going on. The new government wanted 
		to make sure that the country will never fall back into a monarchy, and thus imposed a revolutionary 
		act that outlawed any aid to members of the monarchy or previously known sympathizers. Arrests skyrocketed, 
		and people were turning on each other. Carlos had to lie to all the people he knew. We pretended I was his 
		son, which at some point I honestly thought that I was. I was young but never forgot who my parents were. For 
		over two years I didn't go to school and barely left the property. I had my childhood taken away from me
		and forced to live in hiding. I couldn't live like this. Carlos agreed, and he reached out to my siblings 
		with the utmost secrecy. We decided to flee and live in exile. We had no idea what had happened to our parents, 
		but deep down we all knew they were executed in the palace's raid.</p>

		<p>All borders were heavily protected, and leaving the country required the explicit permission 
		of a high-ranking government official. We didn't have any friends in the new government and could 
		not turn to anyone for help; it was too risky to give up our identities. I was reunited with my 
		siblings in the Amazon jungle, close to the Napo river, where we sought sanctuary with the indigenous 
		communities.</p>

		<p>For a month, we remained under the tutelage of the village elders. My father 
		has always been fond of the uncontacted tribes of the Amazon, and thus were one of the few that 
		were willing to hide us and help us flee.</p>

		<h2>Living in exile</h2>

		<p>After a month with the tribe, we had to move and leave the country. We traveled the rivers deep 
		into the heart of the Amazon. Day and night passed, and one could sense the predators hiding and waiting 
		for the moment to strike. We had nothing with us and lived out of the generosity of the tribe. They took us 
		deeper into the jungle from river to river. We slept in the trees because we feared the anacondas and Jaguars.
	 	After one month, we reached the delta of the Amazon river, and thus Brazil. We took a bus to the city 
		of Curitiba and went to my father's best friend house. That became our home and Fernando, my dad's 
		friend, our father. We have lived in exile ever since the revolution of '03, where Brazil has taken 
		us as guests and refugees. We will never be able to return to our dear home. But now, I have a new home 
		and building a new one here at Tufts University in the small town of Medford.</p>
